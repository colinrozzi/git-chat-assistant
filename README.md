# Git Chat Assistant Actor

A Theater actor that provides an interactive AI chat interface with git tools for managing repositories, creating commits, and understanding git workflows.

## Purpose

This actor serves as a domain-specific chat assistant that:
1. Spawns a chat-state actor as a child with git tool access
2. Automatically configures git MCP tools for repository management
3. Provides a specialized system prompt for git-related tasks
4. Acts as a proxy for chat interactions with git context

## Features

- **Interactive Git Assistant** - Chat with an AI that understands git workflows
- **Git Tool Access** - Built-in access to git commands through MCP actor
- **Smart Configuration** - Automatically enhances any base config with git tools
- **Commit Assistance** - Help with creating meaningful commit messages
- **Repository Analysis** - Understand repository state, history, and changes
- **Best Practices** - Guidance on git workflows and best practices

## Architecture

```
theater-chat â†’ git-chat-assistant â†’ chat-state (with git tools)
                        â†‘                â†“
                        â”œâ”€â”€ GetChatStateActorId
                        â””â”€â”€ AddMessage (forwarded with git context)
```

## Protocol

The actor implements the same protocol as `chat-proxy-example`:

### `GetChatStateActorId`
Returns the actor ID of the spawned chat-state actor with git tools.

### `AddMessage`
Forwards a message to the chat-state actor configured with git capabilities.

## Usage

### Building

```bash
cargo component build --release
```

### Configuration

The actor comes with optimized defaults for git workflows, but **every setting can be customized** through the initial configuration:

**Default Configuration:**
- **Model**: Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced for code tasks)
- **Max Tokens**: 8192
- **Git-specific system prompt** with detailed instructions
- **Built-in git MCP server** for tool access
- **Title**: "Git Assistant"

**Fully Customizable:**
- **Any AI model/provider** (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.)
- **Temperature and token limits**
- **Custom system prompts** (with automatic directory context)
- **Session titles and descriptions**
- **Current directory** for repository context
- **Workflow automation** (commit, review, rebase)
- **MCP server configurations** (advanced)

### Using with theater-chat

#### Basic Usage (No Directory Context)

Create a simple configuration file that points to this actor:

```json
{
  "actor": {
    "manifest_path": "/path/to/git-chat-assistant/manifest.toml"
  }
}
```

#### With Current Directory Context (Recommended)

Create a configuration file that includes the repository path:

```json
{
  "actor": {
    "manifest_path": "/path/to/git-chat-assistant/manifest.toml",
    "initial_state": {
      "current_directory": "/path/to/your/repository"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Automated Commit Workflow (New!)

For automated commit workflows, specify the `workflow` field:

```json
{
  "actor": {
    "manifest_path": "/path/to/git-chat-assistant/manifest.toml",
    "initial_state": {
      "current_directory": "/path/to/your/repository",
      "workflow": "commit",
      "temperature": 0.3,
      "title": "Auto-Commit Assistant"
    }
  }
}
```

Then run:
```bash
theater-chat --config git-config.json
```

With directory context, the assistant will know exactly which repository to operate on and can provide more targeted assistance. With workflow automation, the assistant will automatically start the specified workflow when the session begins.

## Example Interactions

### Interactive Git Assistant

```
ðŸ‘¤ You: What's the current status of my repository?

ðŸ¤– Assistant: I'll check the git status for you.

ðŸ”§ git status

ðŸ’¬ You have 3 modified files and 1 new file:
- Modified: src/lib.rs, Cargo.toml, README.md  
- Untracked: new_feature.rs

Would you like me to help you stage these changes or create a commit?

ðŸ‘¤ You: Help me create a good commit message for these changes

ðŸ¤– Assistant: Let me look at the specific changes first.

ðŸ”§ git diff --staged

ðŸ’¬ Based on the changes I see, here's a suggested commit message:

"feat: Add new feature module and update dependencies

4. **Title Enhancement**: Sets appropriate title if none provided
5. **Tool Context**: Ensures the AI understands available git operations

### Configuration Format

When providing initial state, you can override any of the default settings:

```json
{
  "current_directory": "/path/to/repository",
  "model_config": {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "provider": "openai"
  },
  "temperature": 0.5,
  "max_tokens": 4096,
  "title": "Custom Git Assistant",
  "description": "My specialized git helper",
  "system_prompt": "You are an expert Git consultant..."
}
```

**All fields are optional** - the actor will use sensible defaults for any missing configuration.

#### Supported Configuration Options:

- **`current_directory`** (string): Repository path for context
- **`workflow`** (string): Automated workflow type ("commit", "review", "rebase")
- **`model_config`** (object): Model and provider settings
  - `model`: Model name (e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "gpt-4", "gemini-1.5-pro")
  - `provider`: Provider name ("anthropic", "openai", "google")
- **`temperature`** (number): Sampling temperature (0.0-2.0, default: 0.7)
- **`max_tokens`** (number): Maximum response tokens (default: 8192)
- **`title`** (string): Chat session title (default: "Git Assistant")
- **`description`** (string): Assistant description
- **`system_prompt`** (string): Custom system prompt (will include directory context if provided)
- **`mcp_servers`** (array): Override MCP server configuration (advanced)

#### Configuration Examples:

**Minimal (just directory):**
```json
{
  "current_directory": "/path/to/repo"
}
```

**Automated commit workflow:**
```json
{
  "current_directory": "/path/to/repo",
  "workflow": "commit",
  "temperature": 0.3,
  "title": "Auto-Commit Assistant"
}
```

**Code review workflow:**
```json
{
  "current_directory": "/path/to/repo",
  "workflow": "review",
  "temperature": 0.5,
  "title": "Code Review Assistant"
}
```

**Different model:**
```json
{
  "current_directory": "/path/to/repo",
  "model_config": {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "provider": "openai"
  },
  "temperature": 0.3
}
```

**Custom system prompt:**
```json
{
  "current_directory": "/path/to/repo",
  "system_prompt": "You are a senior DevOps engineer specializing in Git workflows for large enterprise teams. Focus on automation and best practices.",
  "title": "Enterprise Git Consultant"
}
```

## Implementation Details

### State Structure
```rust
struct GitChatState {
    actor_id: String,                    // This actor's ID
    chat_state_actor_id: Option<String>, // Child chat-state actor ID  
    original_config: Value,              // Enhanced chat config with git tools
    current_directory: Option<String>,   // Repository directory context
    workflow: Option<String>,            // Automated workflow type
}
```

### Initialization Flow
1. Parse base chat configuration from initial state (or use defaults)
2. Extract current directory and workflow if provided
3. Enhance configuration with git tools, directory context, and workflow-specific prompts
4. Add directory path and workflow context to system prompt
5. Spawn chat-state actor with enhanced configuration
6. Store chat-state actor ID, directory, and workflow in our state
7. Auto-initiate workflow if specified (e.g., start commit analysis for "commit" workflow)

### Message Handling
- Same as `chat-proxy-example` but with git-enhanced configuration
- All messages forwarded to chat-state actor with git tool access
